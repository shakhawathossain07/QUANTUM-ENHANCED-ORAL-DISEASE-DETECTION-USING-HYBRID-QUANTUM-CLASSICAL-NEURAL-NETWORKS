# QUANTUM-ENHANCED ORAL DISEASE DETECTION USING HYBRID QUANTUM-CLASSICAL NEURAL NETWORKS

This experiment explores oral diseases identification using hybrid quantum-classical neural networks
(HQCNN) and quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNN). We investigated the possibilities
of quantum machine learning in processing complicated dental image data. A whole dataset of oral
disease images was preprocessed to improve model generalization using data augmentation and class
balancing methods, especially ADASYN. Incorporating principle component analysis (PCA) for
dimensionality reduction and angle encoding for quantum state preparation, we created and compared
HQCNN and QCNN architectures. Accuracy, F1-score, recall, precision, and AUROC were among
the criteria used in the training and evaluation of the models. Our results show that with an accuracy of
88.73%, HQCNN exceeded QCNN in binary classification. With a top accuracy of 65.92% utilizing a
3-qubit architecture, HQCNN displayed decent performance for multi-class classification. This work
opens the path by highlighting the possibility of quantum-enhanced machine learning for raising the
accuracy and efficiency of oral disease diagnosis

reduce the dimensionality of data to classify images either as tooth discoloration or dental caries.
